This is the repository for the codes used in my thesis during my internship at the department of Bioinformatics in Maastricht.

The AOP-Wiki provides quarterly downloads. The full AOP-Wiki XML files can be downloaded from: https://aopwiki.org/downloads

The Python scrips work on Python version 2.7.1. The R scripts work on R version 3.4.4.

The SPARQL queries were for each Key Event of the case study AOPs, some of which do not contain any genes.
